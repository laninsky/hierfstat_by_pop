# hierfstat_by_pop
Using hierfstat to get per population overall FIS values

This script will take FSTAT files as input. If you want to do similar stuff with vcftools please see:
https://github.com/laninsky/GBS_SNP_filter/tree/master/utilities

Also note the script here will analyses populations one by one - you may want them analyzed together if you are comparing He and Ho. The code at https://github.com/laninsky/GBS_SNP_filter/tree/master/utilities will also do this.
